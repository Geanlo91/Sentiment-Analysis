"Why ask people to bring their ""VIP"" tickets at 8:15pm if you're not going to let anyone in until after 9pmLA Comedy club wasn't on the directory so we had to ask several employees where the club was. We purchased groupons that said to bring your VIP ticket between 8:15-9:00. We arrived at 8:20 and there were no employees anywhere and the club was closed. There was a make shift line of random customers with the same confusion. We left and came back at 8:45. There at least was now an employee who told us that",LABEL_1,Neutral,0.4845963418483734
"I paid for VIP seating for the show.  What a waste of money!  There was no distinction between general seating and VIP seating.  Some people in front of us has tables, but we did not.  At the least, we should have had a table on which to set our drinks.  The show was fine, but do not waste your money to upgrade to VIP.  I complained the next day to the box office sales booth at Bally's, but they could have cared less.

"Oh puh-leaze!  The good reviews must be written about excellent headliners or by shills.  Got supposedly ""free"" tickets that cost the three of us $40.  They included one watered down drink each.  Yes, even my bottled water (that is clearly labeled $4) cost $10.50, plus a $2.50 upcharge, plus tax, plus whatever else it took to get to the $40.  The MC was horrible, and I never heard so many genitalia jokes in a 60 minute period before from three different comics.

"Ay, yay, yay.  I know why you're reading this review.  Like me, you didn't score tickets for a ""good"" show and are thinking about spending $25 so the night isn't wasted.  Right I know, it happened to me, too.Even if you're offered FREE tickets, do not be tempted.  This guy sucks, royally. Entertainer isn't the right word for this 4th class hack.People, please, listen to me.  I promise I will not steer you wrong.This is the worst performer I have ever had the displeasure of seeing.  He STINKS!  Not funny, no",LABEL_0,Negative,0.9656034111976624
"Without a doubt, the absolute worst Vegas showcomedian I have ever witnessed!  Went to the show hearing that he is so fantastic like many of these reviews, but oh what a surprise. Seriously, not sure how he is employed...Within the first 3- 5minutes of the show, I wasn't sure if his crappy impressions were a real attempt at humor or a bad Andy Kauffman like impression put-on.  After 5 minutes it didn't get better and I was torn between being  embarrassed for him or completely ticked that I actually paid to ",LABEL_0,Negative,0.8792527914047241

And then you go see the show and you wonder if you're in the right theater. I mean the guy doesn't even look anything like in the ads.Anyways, now the review about the show. I went to the show with my sister, and we were probably the youngest ones there, except for the 21st birthday girl who got a b-day shout out in middle of the show.

"Absolute worst show in Las Vegas...  and I am a very lenient guy.  My wife and I are early 30's, Las Vegas residents, and we average 2-3 shows a week.1)  His humor is awful, simply awful.  My wife and I kept looking at each other like ""why are people laughing"".  We had seats 4 rows from the very back, the number of people ""sneaking out"" (aka walking out) was unbelievable, never seen such an exodus from a show.2)  He rewrites song lyrics, with ""toilet humor for Republicans"" (as my lovely wife put it).

Sure, there were a few funny bits, but overall his impersonations were not very good, and his jokes were not very funny.  Skip this one.

"My wife and I caught this show at the Golden Nugget and had heard good things about him in the media, so we were pretty excited to see him. 3 minutes into the show, we were staring at each other in disbelief. Absolutely the corniest sense of humor I've ever had the misfortune of seeing on a stage. His impressions are often dated and usually inaccurate. If he hadn't announced some of them prior to performing them, I would have been at a loss for who he was mimicking. A half hour into the show, we were waitin",LABEL_0,Negative,0.3829881548881531
"This was the dumbest show we have ever seen.  We never laughed once and after 15 minutes we realized we would have 2 more hours of the same boring stupidity.  We're not sure what some of the other reviewers here saw, but there were many people around us who were bored too and never clapped.  Music was extremely loud and theater seating is on level ground and you are looking over the heads in front of you.  Save your money and don't go!

Rudest woman at the cheese counter. Then went to get the fresh pasta and the woman behind the counter was downright nasty. She was covering the pasta at 4:00, they close at 4:30 and I asked her if it was to late to get pasta. She rolled her eyes at me and said uh yeah-we are putting it away right now.
